# TODO

+ Don't embed the nodes code in the pck, let them in a folder next to the bin
+ dynamically load scripts from the right folder (not the same in an exported build)
+ port back all the nodes
+ Use a custom ProtonMesh to store mesh data (instead of mesh instance)
	- required for vertex attributes and other features
+ File dialog
	- warning when selecting a file that's not a node graph
+ Print as text
	- option to show individual array elements / group them
	- collapse individual elements
	- Show total array size
