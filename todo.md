# TODO

+ Don't embed the nodes code in the pck, let them in a folder next to the bin
+ dynamically load scripts from the right folder (not the same in an exported build)
+ port back all the nodes
+ Use a custom ProtonMesh to store mesh data (instead of mesh instance)
	- required for vertex attributes and other features

## Bugs
+ Vector (2 & 3) ui component are not synced with the inspector
+ String / int comparison because idx is a variant
